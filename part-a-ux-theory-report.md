## 1. Introduction

The VUT iEnabler system serves as the primary digital gateway for thousands of students to register for courses, manage academic records, and access essential university services. However, during peak registration periods, the system consistently demonstrates critical user experience failures that create significant barriers to student success. This report examines fundamental UX/UI principles, user research methodologies, and accessibility standards that will inform our redesign of the VUT iEnabler system. By applying user-centered design principles and WCAG guidelines, we aim to transform a frustrating experience into an efficient, accessible, and student-friendly platform.
