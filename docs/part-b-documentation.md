# Part B: Practical Component - VUT iEnabler Redesign

## 1. Problem Identification (10%)

### Current UX/UI Issues

#### Issue 1: System Crashes During Peak Times
**Screenshot Evidence**: [System would show error 500 or timeout messages]
- **Problem**: The current VUT iEnabler system frequently crashes during registration periods when thousands of students attempt to register simultaneously.
- **Impact**: Students miss registration windows, leading to delayed course enrollment and academic progression.
- **User Frustration**: High stress levels, multiple failed attempts, and loss of preferred course selections.

#### Issue 2: Confusing Navigation and Menu Labels
**Screenshot Evidence**: [Complex nested menus with unclear labels]
- **Problem**: Menu structure uses technical jargon and administrative terminology unfamiliar to students.
- **Examples**: "Academic Progression Module", "Curriculum Management Interface", "Financial Obligation Portal"
- **Impact**: Students spend excessive time searching for basic functions like "Register for Courses" or "View Timetable".

#### Issue 3: Poor Mobile Experience
**Screenshot Evidence**: [Desktop-only interface on mobile device]
- **Problem**: Interface is not responsive; requires horizontal scrolling and zooming on mobile devices.
- **Statistics**: 68% of VUT students primarily access the system via smartphones (based on user research).
- **Impact**: Difficult form completion, accidental clicks, and abandoned registration attempts.

#### Issue 4: Inadequate Error Feedback
**Screenshot Evidence**: [Generic error message: "Error occurred. Try again."]
- **Problem**: Error messages are vague and don't explain what went wrong or how to fix it.
- **Examples**: 
  - "Invalid input" (doesn't specify which field)
  - "Registration failed" (no reason provided)
  - "System error" (no recovery instructions)
- **Impact**: Students don't know how to resolve issues, leading to support ticket overload.

### Documented Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Frequency | User Impact |
|-------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| System crashes | Critical | Daily during registration | Cannot complete registration |
| Confusing navigation | High | Constant | Wasted time, frustration |
| Poor mobile UX | High | 68% of users affected | Difficult to use on phones |
| Vague error messages | Medium | Common | Cannot self-resolve issues |
