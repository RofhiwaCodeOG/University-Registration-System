## Part A: Theoretical Component (40%)

### Contents
- `docs/part-a-ux-theory-report.md` - Complete theoretical report (2,100 words)

### Coverage
1. **UX Principles & Critique (15%)**: Usability heuristics, user-centered design, accessibility principles with real-world examples
2. **User Research & Personas (10%)**: Research methods, personas, and journey maps
3. **Accessibility in UX (15%)**: WCAG guidelines, ethical and business perspectives

### Word Count
2,100 words (within 1,800-2,200 requirement)

## Part B: Practical Component (60%)

### 1. Problem Identification (10%)
Documented UX/UI issues with the current VUT iEnabler system:
- System crashes during peak registration periods
- Confusing navigation and technical jargon
- Poor mobile experience (68% of users affected)
- Inadequate error feedback

### 2. User Research & Personas (15%)
Three detailed personas based on interviews and surveys:
- **First-Year Fiona**: Mobile-first user, unfamiliar with university systems
- **Returning Richard**: Experienced user frustrated by inefficiency
- **Part-Time Patricia**: Time-constrained working student

Includes comprehensive user journey maps (before/after redesign).

### 3. Accessibility Audit (10%)
Complete WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance checklist:
- High contrast ratios (7.2:1 average)
- Full keyboard navigation support
- Semantic HTML structure
- Screen reader compatibility
- Mobile responsive design

### 4. Redesign Prototype (15%)
Functional Next.js prototype featuring:
- **Mobile-First Design**: Responsive on all devices, touch-optimized
- **Step-by-Step Process**: Clear 4-step registration flow with progress tracking
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Live course availability, instant conflict detection
- **Accessible by Design**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant throughout

### 5. Final Report & Presentation (10%)
- Complete documentation in `docs/part-b-documentation.md`
- 15-minute presentation outline in `docs/presentation-outline.md`
